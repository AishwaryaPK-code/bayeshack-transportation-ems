### Department of Transportation Prompt #3
_How can data optimize emergency services?_

## Prompt

In 2014 there were more than 6 million traffic crashes in the United States, resulting in 32,675 deaths and 2.3 million injuries. Based on incident and traffic conditions, emergency responders have a number of options for transportation (including helicopter ambulance transport in lieu of ground ambulance). There aren't standardized methods or technologies designed for emergency medical services personnel to predict and optimize transport times by selecting the right response to every incident.

Can rich EMS response data coupled with incident state—including weather conditions, road and traffic conditions, and hospital locations—be used to develop a real-time tool for paramedics and dispatchers?

- 2014 National EMS Dataset: coordinating download logistics. Will be available before event.
- State of Illinois EMS Dataset: ditto.
- The American Trauma Society hosts a [comprehensive index of trauma centers](http://www.amtrauma.org/?page=FindTraumaCenter) in the United States that incorporates service information.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National Center for Statistics and Analysis [open data portal](http://www.nhtsa.gov/NCSA) with troves of high-level statistics. They also run the [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov//QueryTool/QuerySection/SelectYear.aspx), which can be queried year-by-year for individual traffic accident conditions and outcomes.
